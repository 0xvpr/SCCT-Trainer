# Splinter Cell Chaos Theory Trainer
  
### Overview:
This is a repository for a Splinter Cell Chaos Theory DLL that I built entirely in C.  
The only compiler I used throughout the project was mingw's i686-w64-mingw32-gcc comipiler.  

The main purpose of this project was to get familiar with the C language while also  
familiarizing myself with cross platform compilation from Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)  
to Windows (10 Pro Insider Preview Build 21318.rs_prerelease.210216-1530).
